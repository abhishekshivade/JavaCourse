    2.  catch
    3.  finally
    4.  throw
    5.  throws

 ***

 1. try


 try{
 //exception code
 }
 catch(exceptionClassName objectName){
 //code
 }

 ***    if exception is known
 try{
 demoString name = null
 }
 catch(nullPointer e){
 //msg for user
 }


 ***    if exception is unknown
 try{
 demoString name = null
 }
 catch(exception e){
 //msg for user
 }
